# Magshimim First Year - Solution

## Introduction

This repository contains my solution for the **Magshimim First Year** programming challenges. The solution demonstrates my approach to problem-solving, efficient coding practices, and structured implementation of algorithms.

## Project Structure

The repository consists of:

- **Source Code**: Implementation of the assigned tasks in an organized and readable format.
- **Documentation**: Explanation of the approach, logic, and methodology used in the solution.
- **Test Cases**: Sample input and output cases to validate correctness.

## Technologies Used

- **Programming Language**: C / Python (specify based on the language used)
- **Development Environment**: Visual Studio Code / GCC / Clang / Any other IDE used
- **Version Control**: Git

## Approach & Solution

The solution follows a structured methodology:

1. **Problem Analysis**: Understanding the problem requirements, constraints, and expected outputs.
2. **Algorithm Design**: Planning an efficient approach to solve the problem with optimal complexity.
3. **Implementation**: Writing clean, modular, and well-documented code.
4. **Testing & Debugging**: Running various test cases to ensure correctness and performance.
5. **Optimization**: Refining the code to enhance efficiency and readability.

## How to Run

The execution of the code depends on whether it requires parameters or not:

- **Without parameters**:
  - **C Solution**:
    ```sh
    gcc solution.c -o solution
    ./solution
    ```
  - **Python Solution**:
    ```sh
    python solution.py
    ```

- **With parameters** (example usage):
  - **C Solution**:
    ```sh
    gcc solution.c -o solution
    ./solution <param1> <param2>
    ```
  - **Python Solution**:
    ```sh
    python solution.py <param1> <param2>
    ```

## Example Test Case

### Input:
```
(sample input format)
```

### Output:
```
(expected output format)
```

## Future Improvements

- Improve efficiency using advanced data structures.
- Add more edge case testing.
- Implement GUI or visualization for better understanding.
